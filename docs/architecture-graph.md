## üóÑÔ∏è Data Persistence Model (Abstracted)

This ERD shows you know how to model data with relationships, but it generalizes "Orders" and "Trades" into "Transactions," and "PNL" into "Analytics." This is a common pattern in many applications (like e-commerce, logging, etc.) and is much less revealing.

**Pro-tip:** For showing off *dev skills*, the architecture diagram above is often more powerful than a database schema. You might consider only showing that first diagram.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER ||--o{ ACCOUNT : owns
    ACCOUNT ||--o{ TRANSACTION : creates
    TRANSACTION ||--|{ TRANSACTION_DETAIL : leads_to
    TRANSACTION_DETAIL ||--|{ ANALYTICS_RECORD : generates

    USER {
      int id
      string email
      string hashed_password
      datetime created_at
    }

    ACCOUNT {
      int id
      int user_id
      decimal balance
      string status
      datetime created_at
    }

    TRANSACTION {
      int id
      int account_id
      string type
      string status
      decimal amount
      datetime created_at
    }

    TRANSACTION_DETAIL {
      int id
      int transaction_id
      string description
      decimal executed_value
      datetime executed_at
    }

    ANALYTICS_RECORD {
      int id
      int detail_id
      string metric_name
      decimal metric_value
      datetime calculated_at
    }
